This can be very useful for automating the assignment of orders to trades. NOTE: only daily flex reports include this field.
* The performance overview page now allows you to select a currency if you want to see the performance of your account in non-USD currencies.
* Added Average trade return by day, hour, day & hour to performance report.

* Updated QDMS client to latest version.

0.3.4
------------------------
* Fixed a bug that caused orders to be cloned incompletely. This in turn fixes the issue of trades becoming unclosable if they contain virtual orders.
* The strategy correlation matrix and MDS chart now also include the benchmark, if it has been specified.
* The order and size of columns for all the grids are saved between sessions.
* Fixed a bug in the MDS chart, the coordinates should now properly reflect the distances between each series.

0.3.3

* Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in incorrect values shown in the performance overview.
* Fixed an issue with clearing the database when using MySQL/MariaDB.

------------------------
* Performance reports can now be exported to Excel. Use File -> Export to Excel in the performance report window.
* Report generation settings now also include an instrument filter.

0.1.5
